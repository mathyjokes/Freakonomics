What can you learn about on the Freakonomics Radio Podcast? 
An analysis of transcripts from 468 episodes over the past 10 years can tell you: people, time, and money (and a wordcloud because I couldnâ€™t resist).

This project scraped the transcripts of the Freakonomics Radio Podcast hosted on https://freakonomics.com/archive/ Python (BeautifulSoup). 
It then maniupulated the data and removed common phrases, stopwords, etc using R (tidytext) and created a few images. Because it's hard to resist, a word cloud got in there.
